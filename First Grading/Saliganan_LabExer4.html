    <h1>How Can Senate Opposition Bets Win in 2025?</h1>
    <h2>A coordinated Left opposition must energize grassroots campaigning and provide a viable alternative to elite-driven politics to sway voters into giving it a chance to secure Senate posts.</h2>

        Where is the Opposition Now?
        </p>
    <p>
While conventional ideas of the opposition revolve around merely opposing the ruling administration, this definition risks grouping traditional politicians together with the “genuine opposition,” 
which are the progressives that espouse stances that challenge the status quo, according to Carmel Abao, a political science professor at the Ateneo de Manila University. </p>  


Traditional politicians that some tout as opposition due to falling out with the Marcos administration include the likes of Sara Duterte. Other Dutertes vying for posts include former President Rodrigo Duterte,
 set to run for Davao City’s mayoral elections. Despite their anti-Marcos rhetoric, they are from the same dynastic families that have enacted policies promoting the status quo of pro-elite thrust and anti-dissent
  regulations, including the <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/07/philippines-dangerous-antiterror-law-yet-another-setback-for-human-rights/" target="_blank">Anti-Terrorism Act,</a>
  <a href="https://eastasiaforum.org/2022/12/31/dutertes-china-gambit-to-bongbongs-balancing-act/" target="_blank">pro-China foreign policy,</a> and

   </p>


Instead, the genuine opposition is found in the marginalized sectors advocating for change, said Renato Reyes Jr., campaign manager of the Makabayan coalition. Among other prominent Left groups vying for a Senate 
seat, Makabayan is fielding 11 candidates coming from various sectors, while Partido Lakas ng Masa (PLM) is fielding two labor leaders. </p>


Former senators Kiko Pangilinan and Bam Aquino are also running, both of whom are faring best in recent 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/share/p/1AVGc7b7e2/" target="_blank">preelection surveys</a>
 among all opposition bets, but still narrowly short of making it into the magic 12. 
Other candidates are farther, some not included at all. For one, Makabayan’s Senate bet former Bayan Muna Rep. Teodoro Casiño landed at the 24th rank of Tangere’s October Senatorial

 </p>


The tight competition in the Senate pushes some figures to contend in the House of Representatives party-list race instead, such as Akbayan Party-list first nominee Chel Diokno. Historically,
<a href="https://comelec.gov.ph/php-tpls-attachments/2022NLE/ElectionResults/2022NLE_PartyListSummaryStatementofVotes.pdf" target="_blank">sectoral groups </a> 
such as Gabriela, ACT Teachers Party-list, and Kabataan Partylist fared consistently well in the lower chamber elections. They will run again in the midterm polls. </p>


The diversity of Left and center-left political parties results from ideological differences. This allows for a more pluralistic representation of sectors, but may also prove alliance-building difficult.
 But this does not mean that they are unable to work together. </p>

In an interview with the Collegian, PLM’s Luke Espiritu expressed openness to working with other groups.  Reyes also said the Makabayan coalition is willing to cooperate on the basis of shared platforms. 
Even the <a href="https://www.bworldonline.com/the-nation/2024/09/29/624483/liberal-party-open-to-working-with-makabayan-other-opposition-blocs/#google_vignette" target="_blank">Liberal Party announced</a> 
 its openness to working with coalitions like Makabayan. But in terms of alliance-building, there is currently no broad Left coalition designed to take on the 2025 midterm elections.
        </p>
